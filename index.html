                    <p>Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive brain disorder that causes problems with memory, behavior, and thinking. Drug treatments are available to improve symptoms of Alzheimer’s. <br><br> 
                        However, based on the molecular composition of shilajit, some researchers believe shilajit may help prevent or slowTrusted Source the progression of Alzheimer’s. <br><br>
                        The primary component of shilajit is an antioxidant known as fulvic acid. This powerful antioxidant contributes to cognitive health by preventing the accumulation of tau protein. Tau proteins are an important part of your nervous system, but a buildup can trigger brain cell damage. <br><br>
                        Researchers think that the fulvic acid in shilajit may stop the abnormal buildup of tau protein and reduce inflammation, potentially improving Alzheimer’s symptoms. However, more research and clinical trials are needed.</p><br><br>
